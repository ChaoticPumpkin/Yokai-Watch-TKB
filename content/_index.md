This is a site dedicated to documenting the inner-workings of the Yo-kai Watch games by Level-5. The goal of this site is to help with the development of community made mods, tools, and translations.

This site is still very much a work in progress. While I'll try my best to make sure my or other's contributions are as accurate as possible, there may be mistakes. If you find something that should be changed, feel free to open an issue on [this site's GitHub](https://github.com/ChaoticPumpkin/Yokai-Watch-TKB).
