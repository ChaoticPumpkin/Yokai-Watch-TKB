This is a general archive format used to compress a lot of the game's files. All 3d models, textures, armature, and some sprites are stored in these archives. They are identical to .xa and .xk files other than their extention name.

[Kuriimu2](https://github.com/FanTranslatorsInternational/Kuriimu2) is able to extract, modify, and repack these archives.

Tinifan's [Level-5 Blender Addon](https://github.com/Tiniifan/Level-5-blender-addon) can export external 3d models into a format that Yo-kai Watch can use.
