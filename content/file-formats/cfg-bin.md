| Magic Number (ASCII) | Magic Number (HEX) | File Type |
|----------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| N/A                  | N/A                | Data      |

A general purpose file format for storing text. It is often used for NPC/menu 
dialogue, items at stores, objects on the map, and a lot more. 

For just editing dialogue, [Kuriimu](https://github.com/IcySon55/Kuriimu)
works well. If you need to edit other types of the format, use either a hex 
editor or [CfgBinEditor](https://github.com/togenyan/CfgBinEditor), the 
latter of which is more user friendly, but requires more setup and is quite 
incomplete.
